# Assessment
{: .no_toc }

You can use the course Canvas page to complete the quiz, written submission, and files uploads.  I suggest you download the [assessment document](https://github.com/June-Skeeter/Module2_GEOS270/blob/main/docs/Assessment.md), write down your answers there as you progress through the Content and Application sections.  Then upload your answers to canvas once you have finished the module.
