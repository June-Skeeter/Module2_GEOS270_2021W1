You can use the course Canvas page to complete the quiz, written submission, and files uploads.  I suggest you download the [assessment document](https://github.com/June-Skeeter/Module2_GEOS270/blob/main/docs/Assessment.md), write down your answers there as you progress through the Content and Application sections.  Then upload your answers to canvas once you have finished the module.

# Module Assignment (60 pts)

All written answers should be numbered and record in one document, saved as a .pdf, and uploaded to canvas.  The file submissions should also be saved as .pdf and uploaded as a separate document.  **Written answers can be as brief as you want as long as they answer the question.**

## Application Questions (40 pts)

### Written Answers (20 pts)

[**WA1**](Application_Part1.md#wa1) - 6pts
What does Project "On the Fly" do?

- Displays layers in the map CRS regardless of the data's underlying CRS

[**WA2_1**](Application_Part2_2.md#wa_1) - 6pts
Does this number make sense for the population density of Canada? Why or Why not? 

- No, the unit was is in degrees so the area calculation isn't meaningful 

[**WA2_2**](Application_Part2_2.md#wa_2) - 8pts
The Mercator projection is a cylindrical projection.  The Albers projection is a conic projection.  How can you tell by looking at the graticule?

- The graticule of the Mercator projection's parallels and meridians are straight lines.  The parallels in the Albers are curved and the meridians converge. 

### File Submissions (20 pts)

[**FA1**](Application_Part2_2.md#fa1) - 20pts
Export your layout. Name it “Projections_Compared.pdf”. Upload it to canvas.

- If everything we asked for is on there **and** both map frames are aligned and centered, it exceeds our expectations.  If everything is there but it isn't well aligned 75%.  Missing one of: graticule, scale, or titles would be 50%, missing multiple map elements or using wrong projections would be 25%.

## Content Questions (20 pts)

[**WC1**](Content_Part2_2.md#wc1) - 20pts
Briefly describe the steps of the abstraction process.

See [lecture slide](https://june-skeeter.github.io/Module2_GEOS270/docs/content/Abstraction.html#/17) - Just the steps listed with nothing else 25%, copy pasted straight from the slide would be 50%.  Decent description in their own words 75%.  Thorough description 100%.
