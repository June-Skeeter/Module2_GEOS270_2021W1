# Projected Coordinate Systems

There are many differnt types of Map Projections.  They are classified by how the are projected onto a surface and what kind of deformatoins they impose.

## Choosing a Projection

| Projection Category | Properties | Common Uses |
| :------------- | :-------------: | -------------: |
| Conformal | Preserves local shapes and angles | Topographic maps, navigation charts, weather maps |
| Equal Area | Preserves areas | Dot density maps, thematic maps |
| Equidistant| Preserves distance from one or two specified points to all other points on the map | Maps of airline distances, seismic maps showing distances from an earthquake epicenter |
| Azimuthal | All directions are true from a single specified point (usually the center) to all other points on the map | Navigation and route planning maps |
| Compromise | No point is completely distortion free; distortion is minimized near the center and along the equator | World maps |

# Assessment Questions

### QC7

The Mercator projection should never be used to calculate [Area/Distance/Bearing] . (select all that apply)

### QC8

To calculate population density, you would want to use:

- an equal area projection
- an equidistant projection
- an azimuthal projection
- a geographic coordinate system

### QC9

This type projection is great for displaying a small area like the city of Vancouver is, but it could not be used to display all of Canada on one map.

- Equidistant
- Conformal Conic
- Universal Transverse Mercator
- Equal Area

### QC10

A [large/small] scale map displays a would display beand a [large/small] scale map displays a [large/small] area.

### QC11

Which map would show a larger area?

- 1:1,000
- 1:1,000,000


### QC12

Which map is a large scale map?

- 1:1,000
- 1:1,000,000


### QC13

Map scale is the ______ of a distance on a map compared to distance on the ground.


### QC14

Your choice of map projection is entirely independent from the scale you wish to display your map at [T/F]


### WC1

Briefly describe the steps of the abstraction process.
