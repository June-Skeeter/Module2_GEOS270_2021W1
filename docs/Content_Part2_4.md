# Assessment Questions

### QC7

The Mercator projection should never be used to calculate [Area/Distance/Bearing] . (select all that apply)

### QC8

To calculate population density, you would want to use:

- an equal area projection
- an equidistant projection
- an azimuthal projection
- a geographic coordinate system

### QC9

This type projection is great for displaying a small area like the city of Vancouver is, but it could not be used to display all of Canada on one map.

- Equidistant
- Conformal Conic
- Universal Transverse Mercator
- Equal Area

### WC1
