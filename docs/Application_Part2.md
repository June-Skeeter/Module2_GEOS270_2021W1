# Implications of Projection Choice
{: .no_toc }

Your choice of map projection has important impacts on the results you will get and the accuracy of your analysis.  For example, lets look at population density (D):
D = P/A.  P is the population, we can get that from census data.  A is the area, we have to calculate that from our data layer.  Our calculation of area will be dependent upon the map projection we choose.  Lets look at how that will impact things.

# Download Data

- Simply Analytics file.

You will use this interface in future labs.

## Extract the Data

Open the windows file explorer (folder on bottom ribbon or search the start menu).  Navigate to the downloads folder.  You will see a folder called "Module2.gdb", note the type "Compressed (zipped) Folder" and size 11709 KB.  Right click on the Module2.gdb, choose a zip file manager, and select "Extract files".

### Save it to your Project Folder!

In the pop up window, set your Lab2_Project folder as the Extract to location.
* The lab data is now downloaded and stored in your project folder.


# Determine the Projection

### **QC**

What projection is the layer currently in?

# Calculate Population Density

### **QC**

Which province/territory has the greatest area?

# Change the projection to Lambert Conformal Conic

### **QC**

Look at the province/territory you identify above.  Did the area change?  If so, by how much?

# Change the projection again

This time choose xxx Equal Area

### **QC**

Look at the province/territory you identify above.  Did the area change?  If so, by how much?

# Save your project.

Click Save in the top left of the Arc Pro window.
