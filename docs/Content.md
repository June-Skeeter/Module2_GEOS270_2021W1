# History of GIS

A holistic understanding of GIS can help you use it effectively *and* responsibly.  A good way to start off is to look at the history of the subject.  Where did it come from?  What has it been used for?  How has it impacted people?

## History of Spatial Analysis 

*"The history of spatial analysis is strongly linked to cartography and the development of geography as an academic discipline in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It is now being used in a wide range of disciplines. In biology, spatial analysis can be used to analyze the spatial distribution of plant species or migration patterns of animals, economists use it within spatial econometrics and regional science, while criminologists can analyze the spatial distribution of crime patterns. Within the interdisciplinary field of quality of life research, there are many applications as methods of spatial analysis allow studying the spatial interrelationship of different factors impacting on the quality of life at a specific place."*  - Schulze BÃ¤ing, 2014

# Decolonizing GIS

During the course introduction I said that GIS has historically been used as a tool of oppression in settler societies.  What did I mean by that?  I mean that history is filled with examples of GISystems being used by those in power to influence, direct, or dictate polices and practices that harm marginalized communities.  In some cases, the negative impacts are untended consequences.  In many others, the negative impact is the intended result.  Maps, and the arbitrary, poorly though out lines we draw on them, have enormous power to determine the outcome of someones life.  Which side of a border you grow up on can dictate:

* Which school you attend
* What rights you have
* Your tax rate
* Where you can travel
* What political system you live under


## A Prominent Historical Example: Redlining

[Redlining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining) is the systematic denial of services to racially marginalized groups by government and lending institutions in order to forcibly segregated communities.  For much of the 20th century, redlining was legal and wide spread across North American cities.  The practice has been more thoroughly documented and researched in the US.  The video below gives a thorough overview of the practice and how its negative impacts.  It is very important to note that [Redlining occurred in Canada as well](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43100660).  Much of what is talk about in the video applies the same on this side of the border.
