# Steps of Abstraction

**Earth**: Lumpy ball of rock careening though space and time

**Geoid**: Smoothed topography, less lumpy ball of rock

**Datum**: Completely smoothed oblate spheroid

**Geographic Coordinate System (GCS)**: Spherical coordinate system corresponding to points on the datum

**Projected Coordinate System (PCS)**:Projection of a 3D GCS onto a 2D plane (computer screen, paper map, etc.)
