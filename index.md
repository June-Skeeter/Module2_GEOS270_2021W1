# Coordinate Reference Systems!

Map projections are probably the most complicated, boring, and important concept you will encounter while studying GIS.  They put the **G** in **GIS**.  They are how we take the near infinite complexity of our 3D physical world and represent it as a simplified 2D model (map).

# Learning Outcomes

* Steps of Abstraction: 3D Earth >>> 2D Map
* Local vs. Datums
* Geographic Coordinate Systems
* Coordinate Reference Systems
* Scale

# Deliverables

Every module will be scored out of 100 pts.  For this module will be be submitting one map and a some written responses.  You will also be taking a quiz consisting of multiple choice, numeric input, fill in the blank, etc. type questions.  See the [assessment page](docs/Assessment.md).
